# JasmineProject
This is the project to test 5 javascript APIs of their ability to make various HTTP request.

To enable the post functions, run 
`json-server --watch data.json` 
before launching the website.

[NOTE]
The post requests might fail sometimes. Reasons could be multiple requests querying the local host at the same time. +
To re-run the test, discard the changes on data.json and refresh the Jasmine webpage.
